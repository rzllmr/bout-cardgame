# Bout Card Game
> A card battling game to pick up and play.

__BOUT__ is a game to bring all the fun of your regular Collectible Card Game to the casual player's table. There is no long preparation of unbeatable decks, no single rounds consuming an entire evening and not even any collecting involved.

Just put it to the table and start a bout with anyone!

:woman: :man: 2 players :alarm_clock: 30-90 minutes

## Where to get

[Right here!](https://github.com/rzllmr/bout-cardgame/blob/main/docs/data/bout-cards.pdf) Just download the sheets with all __54 cards__, print it and start right away. Additionally you will need at least about __4 six-sided dice__ and __a box of matches__ or anything else suitable for counting a lot.

## How to play

> An illustrated introduction to the game you can find [here](https://rzllmr.github.io/bout-cardgame/).

You start a _round_ by shuffling all 54 cards and handing each player 9 of them face down. Both of you then start selecting one card to keep for your own _deck_ and hand the rest to the other player. Repeat this until there is only one left. That one is out of the _round_ and can be put back to the others.

\* For the first try you can skip this part and give each player the same 8 cards marked with a :mortar_board:.

You and your opponent should now have a _deck_ of your first __8 fighters__ ready for the bout. Shuffle it and gain __1 die__ for the 9th you had to put out of the game before.

Now you're ready to start the first _turn_. Let the other player begin, so you can keep reading the rules to them as they do it.

### Step I: Draw cards

You start your _turn_ by drawing __3 cards__ from your _deck_ (or less if you're running out of cards). Of those you have to select one to either _play_ or _discard_.

_Playing_ means adding the card to your side of the table face up, making it ready to fight. And by _discarding_ you put it out of the game on your own _discard pile_ but gain another __1 die__. Choose wisely...

__Playing field:__ The area on your side of the table where you have all active cards. Those newly added get a couple of matches according to the number in the top left corner of the card.

__Discard pile:__ A seperate pile of cards besides your _playing field_ and _deck_. All cards residing here are out of the game. Their numbers in the top left corner are added up to determine the end of the game and the winner.

### Step 2: Assign dice

Once you're done _playing_ or _discarding_ a card you have to choose what to do with those on the _playing field_. Each card has up to 3 different _abilities_ that are either _active_, _reactive_ or _passive_. By assigning 1 or 2 dice to an _active_ or _reactive_ _ability_ you choose to use that right away.

You can assign dice to a card only once per _turn_ and only to one of its _abilities_. The dice you will regain when it's your turn again.

__Active ability:__ This _ability_ you can use only in your _turn_.

__Reactive ability:__ This _ability_ you can use at any time. Mostly to counter _abilities_ of your opponent or alter the outcome.

__Passive ability:__ This _ability_ you cannot (!) use directly. It has to be executed on the condition stated on the card.

### Step 3: Take action

After you chose what _ability_ to use, you announce its target and roll the dice required for it. For _abilities_ that have multiple targets you must announce these in order. Only when the number is dependent on the die roll itself you can state them afterwards.

What to make of the die result is described for each _ability_ on the card itself. Just make sure to place the dice upon the card to signify that both, card and dice, are blocked for the rest of this _turn_.

But your opponent doesn't have to abide your action without any response. They can just assign any of their free dice to _reactive_ _abilities_ and execute them as well. And then you can react to that again. Back and forth until both of you are done or out of dice.

Feel free to use the matches to account for all those actions, but it is only the final state of the exchange that goes into effect. Every card left without any then is _eliminated_ and goes to the _discard pile_.

### End of the round

The sum of the numbers in the upper left corner of the cards on the _discard pile_ makes the overall score. When this reaches 12 or more the _round_ is over immediately and the player with the lower score wins.

Congratulations to both of you for completing your first round! :tada:

If you were in for a short bout you can leave it at that and look forward to the next chance to play. But for those of you who want to settle this here and now: please, read ahead...

### Tournament

To complete a tournament you will have to play another 2 _rounds_. Those you start with a new _discard pile_ and your dice count set back to 1. But all cards left on the _playing field_ and in your _deck_ in one _round_ will form the starting _deck_ of the next. Expanded by additional 7 cards you draft in the second and 5 in the third _round_.

After all 3 _rounds_ at last you sum up all 3 _discard piles_. The player with the lower score then is the Champion of the Tournament. :trophy:
