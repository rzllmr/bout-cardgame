        <h2>How to play</h2>
        <div class="frame">
          <div class="aligner"><div class="text">
            You start a <mark>round</mark> by shuffling all 54 cards and handing each player 9 of them face down. Both of you then start selecting one card to keep for your own <mark>deck</mark> and hand the rest to the other player. Repeat this until there is only one left. That one is out of the <mark>round</mark> and can be put back to the others.<br>
            <br>
            * For the first try you can skip this part and give each player the same 8 cards marked with a <i class="fa fa-mortar-board"></i>.

        <div class="frame" style="margin-top: 50px">
          <div class="aligner"><div class="text">
            You and your opponent should now have a <mark>deck</mark> of your first <b>8 fighters</b> ready for the bout. For the one you had to put out of the game before each of you gain <b>1 die</b>.<br>
            <br>
            Now you're ready to start the first <mark>turn</mark>. Let the other player begin, so you can keep reading the rules to them as they do it.
          </div></div>

        <h3>Step I: Draw cards</h3>
        <div class="frame">
          <div class="aligner"><div class="text">
            You start your <mark>turn</mark> by drawing <b>3 cards</b> from your <mark>deck</mark> (or less if you're running out of cards). Of those you have to select one to either <mark>play</mark> or <mark>discard</mark>.<br>
            <br>
            <mark>Playing</mark> means adding the card to your side of the table face up, making it ready to fight. And by <mark>discarding</mark> you put it out of the game on your own <mark>discard pile</mark> but gain another <b>1 die</b>.<br>
            Choose wisely...
          </div></div>
          <div class="sketch">
            <img src="data/white.png">
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="frame" style="margin-top: 50px">
          <div class="aligner"><div class="text">
            <b>Playing field:</b> The area on your side of the table where you have all active cards. Those newly added get a couple of matches according to the number in the top left corner of the card.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Discard pile:</b> A seperate pile of cards besides your <mark>playing field</mark> and <mark>deck</mark>. All cards residing here are out of the game. Their numbers in the top left corner are added up to determine the end of the game and the winner.<br>
          </div></div>
          <div class="sketch">
            <img src="data/white.png">
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Step 2: Assign dice</h3>
        <div class="frame">
          <div class="aligner"><div class="text">
            Once you're done <mark>playing</mark> or <mark>discarding</mark> a card you have to choose what to do with those on the <mark>playing field</mark>. Each card has up to 3 different  <mark>abilities</mark> that are either <mark>active</mark>, <mark>reactive</mark> or <mark>passive</mark>. By assigning 1 or 2 dice to an <mark>active</mark> or <mark>reactive</mark> <mark>ability</mark> you choose to use that right away.<br>
            <br>
            You can assign dice to a card only once per <mark>turn</mark> and only to one of its <mark>abilities</mark>. The dice you will regain when it's your turn again.
          </div></div>
          <div class="sketch">
            <img src="data/white.png">
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="frame" style="margin-top: 50px">
          <div class="aligner"><div class="text">
            <b>Active ability:</b> This <mark>ability</mark> you can use only in your turn.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Reactive ability:</b> This <mark>ability</mark> you can use at any time. Mostly to counter <mark>abilities</mark> of your opponent or alter the outcome.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Passive ability:</b> This <mark>ability</mark> you <ins>cannot</ins> use directly. It has to be executed on the condition stated on the card.
          </div></div>
          <div class="sketch">
            <img src="data/white.png">
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Step 3: Take action</h3>
        <div class="frame">
          <div class="aligner"><div class="text">
            After you chose what <mark>ability</mark> to use, you announce its target and roll the dice required for it. For <mark>abilities</mark> that have multiple targets you must announce these in order. Only when the number is dependent on the die roll itself you can state them afterwards.<br>
            <br>
            What to make of the die result is described for each <mark>ability</mark> on the card itself. Just make sure to place the dice upon the card to signify that both, card and dice, are blocked for the rest of this <mark>turn</mark>.
          </div></div>
          <div class="sketch">
            <img src="data/white.png">
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="frame" style="margin-top: 50px">
          <div class="aligner"><div class="text">
            But your opponent doesn't have to abide your action without any response. They can just assign any of their free dice to <mark>reactive</mark> <mark>abilities</mark> and execute them as well. And then you can react to that again. Back and forth until both of you are done or out of dice.<br>
            <br>
            While you are encouraged use the matches to account for all the changes, it is only the state at the end of the exchange that goes into effect. Every character without any matches left then is <mark>eliminated</mark> and added to the <mark>discard pile</mark>.
          </div></div>
          <div class="sketch">
            <img src="data/white.png">
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3>End of the round</h3>
        <div class="frame">
          <div class="aligner"><div class="text">
            The sum of the numbers in the upper left corner of the cards on the <mark>discard pile</mark> makes the overall score. When this reaches 12 or more the <mark>round</mark> is over and the player with the lower score wins.<br>
            <br>
            Congratulations to the winner!<br>If you were in for a short bout you can leave it at that and look forward to the next chance to play. But for those of you who want to settle this here and now: Please, read ahead...
          </div></div>
          <div class="sketch">
            <img src="data/white.png">

        </div>
        <div class="frame" style="margin-top: 50px">
          <div class="aligner"><div class="text">
            To complete a tournament you will have to play another 2 <mark>rounds</mark>. Those you start with a new <mark>discard pile</mark> and your dice count set back to 1. But all cards left on the <mark>playing field</mark> and in your <mark>deck</mark> in one <mark>round</mark> will form the starting <mark>deck</mark> of the next. Expanded by additional 9 cards you draft in the second and third <mark>round</mark>.<br>
            <br>
            After all 3 <mark>rounds</mark> at last you sum up all 3 <mark>discard piles</mark>. The player with the lower score then is the "Champion of the Tournament".
